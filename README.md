Codes and Slides (pending) for journal paper "Sensing-Enhanced Channel Estimation for Near-Field XL-MIMO Systems", accepted to IEEE JSAC-NGAT'24. [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11809)

# How to use

The original data is provided in `/Code/results`. The plotters in each folder are used to generate the figures in the paper with these data. If you want to generate the data by yourself, you can run the corresponding simulation code in each folder. Note that some of the simulations are time-consuming, so please be patient.

If you have any questions, please create an issue or contact [Shicong Liu](mailto:sc.liu@my.cityu.edu.hk) for help :-D
